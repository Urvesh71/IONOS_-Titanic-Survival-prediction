# IONOS_-Titanic-Survival-prediction

# Data Scientist - Warm Up challenge

Goal of the work: To create the Machine learning model which predicts the Survival or non survival status of the passenger availale in the Titanic ship.

## Files Given:
train.csv and test.csv

## Overview
Three main tasks are carried out  in this project: 
1) Preprocessing the data 
2) Exploratory Data Analysis
3) Creation of the ML Model, find the best suitable model for predicting survivors from given dataset and make prediction on the given test.csv file.

## Outfile file
result_dataframe_test_dataset.csv file is generated which stores the prediction made on the given test.csv file.
